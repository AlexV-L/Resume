										<p>A brief Introduction of Who I am<br />
										</a></p>
									</header>
									<p>I am a highly self-motivated Learner seeking experience and connections in the field of Data Science, IT, and data anylsis. On top of the education for general computer science from college, I have become self-taught to be proficient knowledge in statistical analysis, data manipulation and data visualization. My journey began in February 2017 when I was being trained on how to use SQL for Dental patient and insurance records, and how much improvement could be made to antiquated records keeping in health care, driving me into data science. During that training and classes I dabbled with Python and its librarys with applications with big data on the side to allow me to be more prepared after graduation.</p>
